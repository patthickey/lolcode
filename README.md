# lolcode
language compiler: lexical, syntax, and semantic analyzers

This was a project for my Programming Languages class at Towson University in 2014 created by Adam Conover.
The ProjectDescription.pdf goes into full details about what the project is and how it works.
For simplicity: it turns HTML markup into LOLCODE with a full function lexical analyzer, syntax analyzer, and semantic analyzer.
The interfaces were provided by the professor and I added the rest.
